This repository demonstrates a subtle logic error in Python that can lead to unexpected behavior. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` contains a flaw where a return statement is outside of the if block where it is intended to be used.  This can produce incorrect results without necessarily raising an error. The code also includes a `ZeroDivisionError` for a specific case to highlight that error handling is also important.
